            <p>The breeze of wind had always accompanied me everyday, the smell of sea and the never-ending horizon guided the way. They came to me for a greeting, something that would always be there smiling. Like glittering of sand, soft and warmed by the sun, the emotion that last and will forever stand. 
            The stars had spoken to me through the ocean, they asked me in return to write them stories and put them into motion. Tales that could reach even the deepest of the heart, words that would be not less than an art.
            </p> */}
