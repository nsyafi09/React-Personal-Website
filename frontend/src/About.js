        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
      From the day I breathe my memories, I have always been enticed with the tales of people and things. It has been my passion for a long time. I made this website for a trial, some of the stories I put here are not neccessarily original. Some of them are very highly inspired by others and the world. However, I am planning to release an origninal fantasy novel called "A Salty Path" someday. I have the plot mostly written and a few chapters in my archive. When the time comes, I would love to show it to the world. For now, this is only for fun and to pass my time.
